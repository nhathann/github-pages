1. Maximize early day sunlight exposure within 30–60 minutes of waking. Do that again in the late afternoon, prior to sunset. 
If you wake up before the sun is out and you want to be awake, turn on artificial lights and then go outside once the sun rises.
On bright cloudless days: view morning and afternoon sun for 10 min; cloudy days: 20 min; very overcast days 30-60 min.
Don’t wear sunglasses for this practice if you safely can, but contact lenses and eyeglasses are fine.
No, you don’t have to look directly at the sun, and never look at any light so bright it is painful to view. 
Viewing afternoon sunlight from sunset can help offset some of the negative effects of light viewing in the evening.
Viewing sunlight first thing in the morning 80% of the time – if you miss a day, get twice as much duration of light the next day.
Viewing morning sunlight should be a non–negotiable mental and physical health practice. It’s OK to miss a day every once in a while but if you miss more than one or two days it can really disrupt a large number of biological systems relevant to mental and physical health.
It's easy to establish science–supported , genuinely health promoting, zero–cost habits if we do them in combination: outdoor walks/Zone2 cardio (e.g., jumping rope, fast walking, swimming, running etc., while viewing the sun), done nasal breathing only, followed by cold shower and a light breakfast.
2. Avoid viewing bright lights—especially bright overhead lights between 10 pm and 4 am. 
Here is a simple rule: only use as much artificial lighting as is necessary for you to remain and move about safely at night. Blue blockers can help a bit at night but still dim the lights. Viewing bright lights of all colors are a problem for your circadian system. Candlelight and moonlight are fine. 
3. Exercise
Finish exercising 2 hours before bedtime. Find the right exercise routine that fits your schedule and body. Consistent physical activity, even for just half an hour each day, can help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep.
4. Avoid caffeine within 8-10 hours of bedtime. 
5. Limit daytime naps to less than 90 min, or don’t nap at all. If napping hinder your nighttime sleep, then don’t do it, and never nap for more than 90 minutes—that can really alter your sleep cycles and impair learning. No naps after 3 pm.
6. Use the bedroom for sleep alone.
Keep the bedroom for only sleep will help condition your brain to fall asleep when you jump into bed at night. That means no eating, no texting, no working, and no watching movies in bed. Without all of those other stimuli, your brain will begin to associate your bedroom only with rest and relaxation.
7. Drinking alcohol messes up your sleep. As do most sleep medications.
8. Try to keep a good sleep routine, which means waking up at the same time each day and going to sleep when you first start to feel sleepy, including weekends. 
Our bodies prefer regularity in our activities so that they can better anticipate and prepare for meals, exercise, sleep, etc. These activities become the milestones of our day, together creating a physiological rhythm that is perhaps more important than we once realized. 
While it might be difficult to achieve a perfect sleep routine with the varying activities, work schedules, and travel we have to do, try to incorporate as much sleep consistency as possible into your life for the best results.
9. Get the right amount of sleep.
Getting enough sleep is critical for your health. The “common knowledge” that everyone needs eight hours of sleep every night isn’t quite accurate though. It varies based on a host of factors, including your age, genetics, lifestyle, nutrition, and more. Recommended: 7–9 hours of sleep for adults (18-64 years old).
10. Stay relaxed and comfortable 
It is no surprise that anxiety can keep us from falling asleep. Whether we are worried about stressful events or are afflicted with a more long-term anxiety disorder, it can be frustratingly difficult to fall asleep at night.
11. If you wake up in the middle of the night (which, by the way, is normal to do once or so each night) but you can’t fall back asleep, consider doing a non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) protocol or Yoga Nidra protocol when you wake up. (You can find these protocols on Youtube).
12. Finish eating 3 hours before bedtime.
13. Keep your sleeping space COOL and at the right temperature. Your body needs to drop in temperature by 1-3 degrees to fall and stay asleep effectively. Optimal sleep temperature is between 60–67℉.
14. Deep breathing (using the 4–7–8 breathing technique)
The basic technique of 4–7–8 breath: (a) breathe quietly and through the nose to a count of 4; (b) hold the breath for a count of 7; (c) forcibly blow air out through the mouth for a count of 8.
In the first month of practice, repeating for 4 breath cycles per session. Eventually, you can go up to 8 breath cycles (but no more than that). Do this at least twice a day (in the morning and before going to bed). The real significant effects come after four to six weeks.
15. Keep the room you sleep as DARK as possible. Any light, but especially blue light, will keep your brain from producing melatonin, which is its chemical signal for the body to sleep. If complete darkness is not possible, consider wearing a comfortable sleep mask over your eyes.
16. Sounds for sleep
Nighttime noise seems to be a matter of personal preference: while one person might require complete silence to fall asleep, another person might prefer music. Experiment to find what works best for you. If the place where you sleep are too loud, invest in a good pair of earplugs. 
17. Yoga poses
Yoga practice is comprised of body movement (including stretching, balance, and strength-building). By releasing tension in the body, yoga can be a powerful tool for helping us sleep at night.
18. Kids (and indeed all of us) have changing sleep needs over time. Adjust accordingly.
